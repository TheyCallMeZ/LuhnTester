# LuhnTester
An application that tests explicitly 16 digit credit card numbers against the Luhn Algorithm

I was bored and was searching out random things to code, came across a YouTube video from [Half As Interesting](https://www.youtube.com/c/halfasinteresting) about [Decoding Credit Card Numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwVmE8gcqrg&pp=sAQA)

I later when looking for a number that would validate against both the Luhn Algorithm with and without the check digit found an [infographic at 101Computing.net](https://www.101computing.net/is-my-credit-card-valid/luhn-algorithm/)

I started to write in the logic for "Decoding" the card as mentioned in the video and stopped there for now.
